# Video-To-Audio-With-sound-file-playing-
I made a code using: pygame, tkinter and custom class and functions. 
This Application can convert, play, pause, unpause and more. 
Important notes: 
1) You need to have installed: pygame and tkinter.
2) If you want to add file, so you can operate it, you need to or drag it to audio files, or modify code
